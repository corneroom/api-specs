# Gateway Configuration

This directory contains the merged gateway specification used for deploying to Google Cloud API Gateway.

## Merged Specification

The `merged.yaml` file in this directory is automatically generated by the merge-specs.js script. It combines individual service specifications from the `../services/` directory and resolves any conflicts or overlaps.

**Do not manually edit this file!** It will be overwritten during the CI/CD process.

## Gateway Deployment

The merged specification is automatically deployed to:

- Staging environment when pushing to the `develop` branch
- Production environment when pushing to the `main` branch

## Environment Endpoints

- Staging: https://staging-api-gateway-[hash].gateway.dev
- Production: https://api-gateway-[hash].gateway.dev
